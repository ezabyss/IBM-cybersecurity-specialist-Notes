## 🖥️ 1. Hardware Fundamentals  
Understanding hardware helps detect physical vulnerabilities and malicious device behavior.

### **Key Concepts**
- Hardware includes: **CPU, RAM, storage, monitor, keyboard, mouse**.
- Hardware components process, store, and manage data.
- Attacks can hide in hardware (infected USBs, compromised firmware).
- Hardware monitoring helps prevent unauthorized access.

---

## 🧵 2. Operating Systems (OS)  
The OS is the bridge between hardware and software—attackers often target OS weaknesses.

### **Key Concepts**
- OS manages: memory, files, processes, permissions.
- Examples: Windows, Linux, macOS.
- Cybersecurity tasks include:
  - Monitoring system activity  
  - Applying patches & updates  
  - Managing user privileges  
- OS knowledge helps detect anomalies and stop privilege escalation.

## 🌐 3. Networking Basics  
Most cyberattacks happen over networks, making networking knowledge essential.

### **Key Concepts**
- Networking connects devices to share data.
- Involves:
  - Routers, switches, firewalls  
  - Protocols (TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP, HTTPS)  
  - Network topologies  
- Professionals must identify:
  - Suspicious traffic  
  - Unauthorized access  
  - Network scanning attempts  
  - MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks

## 💻 4. Programming Basics  
You don’t need to be a full-time coder—but basic programming is extremely helpful.

### **Key Concepts**
- Programming enables automation and problem solving.
- Useful for:
  - Writing scripts  
  - Understanding malware behavior  
  - Identifying insecure code  
  - Creating security tools  
- Common languages in cybersecurity:
  - **Python, Bash, PowerShell, JavaScript, SQL**

---

## 🗄️ 5. Database Fundamentals  
Databases store valuable information—making them a top target for attackers.

### **Key Concepts**
- Databases store structured data (users, transactions, records).
- Cybersecurity skills needed:
  - SQL & NoSQL basics  
  - Access control management  
  - Encryption  
  - Backup & recovery procedures  
- Understanding databases helps prevent:
  - SQL injection  
  - Unauthorized data access  
  - Data corruption

---

## ☁️ 6. Cloud Fundamentals  
As businesses migrate to the cloud, cloud security skills are in high demand.

### **Key Concepts**
- Cloud providers offer:
  - **IaaS, PaaS, SaaS**
- Cloud enables fast resource deployment but increases risks.
- Cyber professionals must understand:
  - Shared Responsibility Model  
  - IAM (Identity and Access Management)  
  - Secure storage & network configuration  
  - Cloud logging & monitoring  

---

## 🎯 Final Takeaways  
- IT fundamentals are the **foundation** of cybersecurity.  
- Mastering hardware, OS, networking, programming, databases, and cloud improves your ability to:
  - Detect vulnerabilities  
  - Prevent attacks  
  - Respond to incidents  
  - Protect systems effectively  
- These skills remain essential throughout every stage of a cybersecurity career.
