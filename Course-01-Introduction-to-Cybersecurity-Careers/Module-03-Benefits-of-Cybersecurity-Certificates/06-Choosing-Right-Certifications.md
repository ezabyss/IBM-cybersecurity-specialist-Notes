After this video, I can:

## 1️⃣ Start With My Career Goals

Before picking any exam, I should ask:

- What **role** do I want? (e.g., ethical hacker, analyst, manager, risk specialist)
- What **skills** do I want to develop next?
- Am I **new to cybersecurity** or already working in IT?

My **career direction** should guide my certification choice.

## 2️⃣ Major Certifications Mentioned

### 🔹 CompTIA Security+ (Foundational)

### 🔹 CEH – Certified Ethical Hacker (Offensive Security)

- Focuses on **ethical hacking techniques**
- Teaches how to **think and act like an attacker**  
  so I can better **defend systems**

👉 Good choice if I’m especially interested in **offensive security / hacking**.

---

### 🔹 CISSP – Certified Information Systems Security Professional (Leadership)

- Designed for people aiming at **senior / leadership roles**
- Covers **information security principles, policies, and strategy**
- Focuses more on **management, governance, and high-level design**  
  rather than only hands-on technical tasks

## 3️⃣ Factors to Consider When Selecting a Certification

When I choose a certification, I should think about:

### 🎯 Career Fit
- Does this certification match my **ideal role**?
- Do employers in that role **actually ask** for this certification?

### 📚 My Current Knowledge
- Am I **brand new** to cybersecurity? → Start with **foundational** certifications  
- Do I already have **IT experience**? → Choose something that **builds** on my existing skills

### ⏰ Time & 💸 Cost

- How much **study time** is realistic for me right now?
- What is the **exam fee**, and are there **renewal / recertification costs**?
- Some certs require **continuing education** to stay valid.

### 🏢 Employer Support

- Many employers **help pay for certifications**
- I should check if my **current or future employer** offers:
  - Exam fee reimbursement  
  - Training materials  
  - Study time support

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Networking & Real-World Insights

- Talk to people who **already work** in the role I want
- Ask:
  - Which certifications helped them the most?
  - Which ones are **actually respected** in their company/industry?

## 4️⃣ How Certification Adds Value

A certification can:

- **Open doors** to interviews and new roles  
- Show that I’m serious about **learning and growth**
- Help me structure my learning around **clear objectives**

But its **true value** depends on:

- How well it matches my **career goals**
- My **effort** in building real skills, not just passing the exam
- Whether I keep **learning and practicing** even after getting certified

## ✅ Key Takeaways for Myself (Abhishek / EzAbyss)

1. Don’t pick a certification just because it’s popular.  
   → Pick it because it fits **my target role**.
2. If I’m early in my journey, **Security+** is a strong foundation.  
3. If I love hacking and offensive security, aim for **CEH** later.  
4. If I want to move into **management/leadership**, keep **CISSP** in mind.  
5. If I’m drawn to **risk and governance**, **CRISC** is a good future option.  
6. Certifications are an **investment of time, money, and energy**—I should be ready to commit.  
7. No certification replaces **real skills and dedication**. Both must grow together.

## 📌 My Action Plan

- Clarify my **short-term goal** (e.g., “entry-level security analyst”).
- Research **job postings** and check which certs they mention.
- Pick **one certification** that:
  - Fits my level
  - Matches my desired role
  - I can realistically afford (time + money)
- Create a **study plan** and timeline for that certification.

> **Reminder to myself:**  
> The right certification can open doors,  
> but my **consistent practice, curiosity, and effort** are what will truly move my cybersecurity career forward. 🛡️
