### **Course 01 – Cybersecurity Careers**  
### **Personal Notes by Abhishek (Ez Abyss) **

# 📜 1. Cybersecurity Didn’t Start as a “Career”  
- Around the early 2000s, **cybersecurity wasn’t even a formal job title**.  
- Most companies had a few IT people who suddenly became “the security team.”  
- No training, no structure — just “figure it out.”  
- Early cybersecurity work was survival-based:  
  - Handling DDoS attacks  
  - Securing networks  
  - Reacting to threats with limited knowledge  

### 🧠 Personal reflection  
It’s crazy to think cybersecurity began as improvisation rather than a well-defined profession.
