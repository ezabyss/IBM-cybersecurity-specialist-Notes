## 🔐 Why I Started Cybersecurity

My interest in cybersecurity began during a period when I was taking a break after completing my bachelor’s degree and feeling confused about what direction to take next.

Then something happened in my hometown:

> A new hospital opened recently with **two open IT-related security positions**, yet **zero applicants** showed up.  
> That moment made me realize how important and rare cybersecurity skills have become — even in small towns.

This pushed me to explore cybersecurity seriously.

### **Reasons I chose this path:**
- I want to understand **how digital systems are protected**
- The program includes **hands-on labs**
- It prepares for essential entry-level certifications like:
  - ✔️ **ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC)**
  - ✔️ **CompTIA ITF+**
  - ✔️ Partial preparation for **ISC2 SSCP**
- I want skills that are **practical, in-demand, and future-proof**

Step by step, I’m building my confidence in cybersecurity fundamentals.
